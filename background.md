# Automatic Differentiation & Related Graphs


## General Introduction

- P. Ruffwind, “Reverse-mode automatic differentiation: a tutorial,” Rufflewind’s Scratchpad.

Best general introductory overview I found of what happens in the details of forward and reverse mode, compared, and with 
good graphics.  Also explains tapes (and provides Rust code to look at).

- A. Radul, “Introduction to Automatic Differentiation,” Conversations.

Very high-level introduction of terms and concepts.


## General Papers

Survey paper with a lot of examples and comparison of state of the art implementations.

- B. van Merriënboer, O. Breuleux, A. Bergeron, and P. Lamblin, “Automatic differentiation in ML: Where we are and where we should be going,” Oct. 2018.

Gives a concise overview over state of the art methods, and introduces Myia, an AD framework based on python and functional principles.
